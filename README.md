# AutoAnalytics

This application identifies and performs a number of common analyses for classical molecular dynamics simulations, parsing information ranging from simulation and molecule type to specific interactions which may be of interest.

### AGIMUS Integration

When installed as part of the AGIMUS suite, AutoAnalytics can be called by AutoMD, AutoQuantum, or DataSetBuilder while also using FeatureFinder to identify additional analyses which may be of interest.
